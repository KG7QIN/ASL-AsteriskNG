This version of Asterisk 1.8.32.3 has been slightly modified to work with the app_rpt.c module
that is the heart of AllStarLink.

Due to a change in how Asterisk 1.4 and 1.8 work internally, app_rpt.c will not work on an
unmodified Asterisk 1.8.32.3 system.  Using it with an unmodifed Asterisk 1.8.32.3 system will
result in a system that appears to work, but with any calls passed to app_rpt immediately being 
hung up.


This code is provided AS IS without any warranty at all.

All copyrights on the original code, be it Asterisk or the AllStarLink modules still apply,

You must be able to compile Asterisk 1.8.32.3 and understand how this process works to use the additional
modules included here.

This code is provided in an attempt to move AllStarLink forward with the eventual goal of getting it
to work wtih/on newer versions of Asterisk.

Please do not send requests for help/bugs to me directly.  Use the link in the github repository
for reporting bugs, as this will be the best way to ensure that colloboration can occur.

Thank you.
